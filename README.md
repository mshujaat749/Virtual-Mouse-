# Virtual-Mouse- 
A virtual mouse is a software that allows users to control the cursor and perform mouse actions on a computer screen without using a physical mouse. There are different ways to implement a virtual mouse, such as using a touchpad, a numeric keypad, a camera, or hand gestures. A virtual mouse can be useful for people who have difficulty using a regular mouse, or for situations where a mouse is not available or convenient. 
- Virtual Mouse using Hand Gestures, which is an IEEE paper that proposes a system that uses a camera and image processing techniques to recognize hand gestures and control the mouse functionalities‚Å¥.
